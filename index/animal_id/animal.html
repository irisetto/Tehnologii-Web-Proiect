            While the African penguin may not be found in freezing temperatures,
            they are covered in an array of black, white, and gray dense,
            waterproof feathers that keep them dry and warm in the cold waters
            off the African coast. They also have a number of dot-like markings
            flecked across their white chests. These flecks help to
            individualize each penguin, as each penguin's feather pattern is as
            individual as a human's fingerprints. African penguins have a
            distinct, sharply pointed beak and black feet. The African penguin
            is one of the smallest penguin species. Males are generally slightly
            larger than their female counterparts.

              African penguins are also widely known as "jackass" penguins, for
              their donkey-like bray.

              <span>African penguins communicate</span>
              with one another through vocalizations and body language. Each
              individual has its own unique vocalization that distinguishes it
              from the others. They use three different types of calls: a bray,
              used to attract a mate; the yell, used to defend their territory;
              and the haw, used by mates to locate each other when one is on
              land and one is at sea. When a penguin is feeling aggressive, it
              communicates through body language like gaping, pointing the bill,
              pecking, and bill-jabbing.

              African penguins can be found in large colonies along the
              southwestern rocky coast of Africa from Namibia to Port Elizabeth,
              and many of the surrounding islands.

              <span>Being fast swimmers</span>
              allows them to catch a variety of prey from the sea, including
              sardines and anchovies, as well as squid and crustaceans. These
              hearty little penguins can hold their breath over 2 minutes and
              dive over 400 feet deep! A penguin may eat up to 1 pound of food
              or 14 percent of its body weight per day. At the Zoo, penguins
              enjoy sardines, capelin, and night smelt. They swallow their fish
              whole!
